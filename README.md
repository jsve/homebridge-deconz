## Hardware
I'm using a Raspberry Pi running standard raspbian. To talk to zigbee devices such as Philips Hue and IKEA Tr√•dfri I'm using this USB stick:

## Finding and signing on to the gateway's web-interface
Using

It is simle to find the Pi and the proper port to use. Standard user and password is "delight". This can, and should, be changed in the settings, once signed on.


## Adding devices
You need to open the gateway to be able to add new devices (lights). This is possible through the web-interface as well as through the ordinary GUI. The device needs to be really close to the usb-stick to be added. 

I've had different experiences when trying to add devices. Sometimes I need to access the GUI on the raspberry (VNC or connected monitor) and make some commands to the unit before it shows up in the web-interface.

Once added, I've been using the web-interface to add the device to the proper group.


## Documentation
